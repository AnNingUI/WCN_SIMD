# WCN_SIMD Development Roadmap

## Project Vision

WCN_SIMD aims to provide a **zero-overhead, cross-platform SIMD abstraction layer** that enables developers to write high-performance vectorized code once and run it efficiently across all major CPU architectures.

### Core Design Principles

- **Zero-overhead abstraction**: Direct mapping to native hardware intrinsics
- **Compile-time platform detection**: No runtime overhead for platform selection
- **Performance-first design**: Optimized for maximum throughput
- **API consistency**: Identical function signatures across all platforms
- **Easy to use and maintain**: Clear, intuitive naming conventions

## Development Status

### ‚úÖ Phase 1.1: Core 128-bit SIMD Foundation (COMPLETED)

**Goal**: Establish basic 128-bit SIMD operations across all major platforms

**Status**: **100% Complete** - All platforms synchronized

**Platforms Implemented** (8 architectures, 37 files):
- ‚úÖ **x86/x86_64** (18 files): SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AVX, AVX2, AVX-512F, FMA
- ‚úÖ **ARM** (6 files): NEON (ARMv7/ARMv8), SVE, SVE2
- ‚úÖ **LoongArch** (4 files): LSX (128-bit), LASX (256-bit)
- ‚úÖ **PowerPC** (4 files): AltiVec, VSX
- ‚úÖ **MIPS** (2 files): MSA
- ‚úÖ **RISC-V** (2 files): RVV (scalable vector extension)
- ‚úÖ **WebAssembly** (2 files): SIMD128
- ‚úÖ **Atomic Operations**: 18 platform-specific atomic headers

**Core Operations Implemented** (143-155 functions per platform, 153 unified APIs):
- Load/Store (aligned and unaligned)
- Initialization (set1, setzero for all data types)
- Arithmetic (add, sub, mul, div for 8/16/32/64-bit integers and floats)
- Saturating arithmetic (adds/subs for signed/unsigned 8/16-bit)
- Logical operations (and, or, xor, andnot)
- Shift operations (sll, srl, sra with variable and immediate counts)
- Comparison operations (eq, gt, lt, ge, le, neq)
- Min/Max operations (signed/unsigned 8/16/32-bit, float, double)
- Square root and reciprocal approximations
- Absolute value and negation
- Broadcast operations
- Type conversions (int32 ‚Üî float)
- Integer multiplication (16-bit mulhi/mullo, 32-bit mullo, 32-bit widening)
- Pack/Unpack operations (with saturation)
- Extract/Insert operations
- Movemask operations
- Blend/Select operations
- Byte shuffle operations

### ‚úÖ Phase 1.2: Unified Top-Level Interface (COMPLETED)

**Goal**: Expose platform-agnostic macros for all synchronized operations

**Status**: **100% Complete**

**Achievement**:
- All 94+ operations exposed through unified `wcn_simd_*` macros
- Users can write portable SIMD code without knowing the underlying platform
- Zero performance overhead - macros directly expand to platform-specific calls

**Example Usage**:
```c
// This code works identically on all platforms
wcn_v128i_t a = wcn_simd_load_i128(ptr);
wcn_v128i_t b = wcn_simd_set1_i32(42);
wcn_v128i_t result = wcn_simd_add_i32(a, b);
wcn_simd_store_i128(output, result);
```

### üöß Phase 2: Advanced SIMD Operations (PLANNED)

- Integer division emulation
- Rotate operations
- Population count (popcount)
- Leading/trailing zero count

## Development Principles

### API Design Philosophy

1. **Explicit over Implicit**: Function names clearly indicate operation and data type
2. **Consistent Naming**: `wcn_v128{type}_{operation}_{width}` pattern
3. **No Surprises**: Behavior matches user expectations based on name
4. **Type Safety**: Wrapper structs prevent accidental type misuse

### Performance Guarantees

- All operations compile to **single hardware instruction** (or optimal sequence)
- No runtime branching for platform selection
- Inline functions ensure zero function call overhead
- Compiler optimizations fully preserved

### Portability Strategy

- Use standard compiler intrinsics (no inline assembly)
- Conditional compilation for platform selection
- Graceful degradation where hardware support is missing
- Consistent behavior across platforms (within floating-point precision limits)

## Testing Status

## Contributing

WCN_SIMD is actively developed. Contributions are welcome in the following areas:

- **Platform Testing**: Help test on physical hardware for non-x86 platforms
- **Bug Reports**: Report incorrect behavior or platform-specific issues
- **Performance Optimization**: Suggest improvements to intrinsics usage
- **Documentation**: Improve examples, tutorials, and API documentation
- **New Platforms**: Add support for additional SIMD architectures
- **Testing Framework**: Help build comprehensive test suite

## Current Limitations

1. **No runtime CPU feature detection**: Platform selection is compile-time only
2. **Limited 256-bit support**: Only 128-bit operations currently implemented
3. **Limited scalable vector support**: RISC-V RVV basic implementation complete, advanced features pending
4. **Testing gaps**: Comprehensive testing framework not yet implemented
5. **No advanced operations**: Horizontal operations, gather/scatter not yet available

## Future Vision

**Long-term Goal**: Become the **de-facto standard** for cross-platform SIMD programming in C/C++, providing:

- Complete coverage of all SIMD-capable architectures
- Performance parity with hand-written intrinsics code
- Rich library of vectorized algorithms
- Comprehensive documentation and tutorials
- Active community and ecosystem support
